  # 2025 BBB Mock Draft 1.0
  
  With the NFL Draft just weeks away, it's time to look at how our rookie draft might unfold. Based on team needs, pick positions, and the current NFL Draft projections, here's my prediction for the first round.
  
  ## Round 1
  
  ### 1.01 - Team Vikingsfan80
  **Projected Pick: Marvin Harrison Jr., WR, Ohio State**
  
  Vikingsfan80 needs a true WR1 to pair with J.J. McCarthy for the future. Harrison is the consensus top WR in this class and would immediately become a centerpiece for this rebuilding roster.
  
  ### 1.02 - Team aintEZBNwheezE
  **Projected Pick: Caleb Williams, QB, USC**
  
  With Jordan Love as the only established QB on the roster, aintEZBNwheezE needs to secure their QB room. Williams has the highest ceiling of any QB in this class and would be impossible to pass up here.
  
  ### 1.03 - Team DylanBears2022
  **Projected Pick: Malik Nabers, WR, LSU**
  
  DylanBears2022 has a solid team but could use another weapon at WR. Nabers would complement Tyreek Hill and eventually become the WR1 as Hill ages.
  
  ### 1.04 - Team Delusional1
  **Projected Pick: Brock Bowers, TE, Georgia**
  
  With Dallas Goedert aging, Delusional1 could use the best TE prospect in years. Bowers would give their roster the kind of positional advantage that's hard to find.
  
  ### 1.05 - Team Chewy2552
  **Projected Pick: Jayden Daniels, QB, LSU**
  
  Chewy2552 has an aging QB room and could use an infusion of youth. Daniels' dual-threat ability makes him a perfect fantasy QB with tremendous upside.
  
  ### 1.06 - Team tylercrain
  **Projected Pick: Rome Odunze, WR, Washington**
  
  Tylercrain has several aging WRs and needs to get younger at the position. Odunze's complete game would be a perfect fit alongside Tua Tagovailoa.
  
  ### 1.07 - Team Vikingsfan80
  **Projected Pick: Ollie Gordon II, RB, Oklahoma State**
  
  With their second first-round pick, Vikingsfan80 addresses RB by taking the first one off the board. Gordon's three-down skillset would give them a foundation piece.
  
  ### 1.08 - Team EthanL21
  **Projected Pick: Troy Franklin, WR, Oregon**
  
  EthanL21 could use more depth at WR, and Franklin's big-play ability would be a perfect complement to their existing roster construction.
  
  ### 1.09 - Team mlthomas5095
  **Projected Pick: Keon Coleman, WR, Florida State**
  
  Mlthomas5095 needs size at WR, and Coleman's contested-catch ability makes him a red zone threat from day one.
  
  ### 1.10 - Team jwalwer81
  **Projected Pick: Jonathon Brooks, RB, Texas**
  
  Jwalwer81 needs young RB talent, and Brooks has the three-down ability to be a fantasy difference-maker if his recovery from injury goes well.
  
  ### 1.11 - Team Schoontang
  **Projected Pick: Blake Corum, RB, Michigan**
  
  Schoontang could use more RB depth behind Bijan Robinson. Corum is a high-floor prospect who could contribute immediately.
  
  ### 1.12 - Team Henrypavlak3
  **Projected Pick: Brian Thomas Jr., WR, LSU**
  
  Henrypavlak3 closes out the first round by adding a vertical threat in Thomas to complement Chris Olave.
  
  ## Key Storylines to Watch
  
  1. **QB Market**: Will the QB-needy teams at the top of the draft get their targets, or will someone trade up?
  2. **RB Value**: With several teams needing RB help, will we see a run on the position in the late first?
  3. **Trade Activity**: Several teams have multiple picks in the first three rounds. Expect active trading as teams target specific players.
  
  Stay tuned for Mock Draft 2.0 after the NFL Draft when we'll have more clarity on landing spots!
